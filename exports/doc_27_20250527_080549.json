They must be prepared for various responses, including silence, anger, or tears. The verbal response should remain calm, direct, and honest. HR should \"pause and listen\" and be prepared to offer verbal support, such as \"Is there someone I can call for you?\" or \"Would you like to take a brief break?\". It is imperative to avoid \"false promises\" or telling employees \"they'll be fine\"."
